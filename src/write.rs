//! This module contains functions for writing in a background thread.
//!
//! * The simplest to use is the [`writer`](fn.writer.html) function. It accepts
//! any `io::Write` instance that implements `Send`.
//! * The [`writer_init`](fn.writer_init.html) function handles cases where the
//! wrapped writer cannot be sent safely across the thread boundary by providing
//! a closure for initializing the writer in the background thread.
//! * [`writer_finish`](fn.writer_finish.html) and
//! [`writer_init_finish`](fn.writer_init_finish.html) provide an additional
//! `finish` closure, which allows for executing final code after *all* writing
//! finished or also for returning the wrapped writer to the main thread.
//!
//! # Error handling
//!
//! * `io::Error`s occurring during writing in the background are returned by
//!   the `write` method of the [writer in the main thread](struct.Writer.html)
//!   as expected, but with a delay of at east one call.
//! * The `func` closure running in the main thread allows returning errors of
//!   any type. However, in contrast to the functions in the `read` module, the
//!   error needs to implement `From<io::Error>` because additional `write`
//!   calls can happen in the background **after** `func` is already finished,
//!   and eventual errors have to be returned as well.
//! * If an error is returned from `func` in the main thread, and around the
//!   same time a writing error happens in the background thread, which does not
//!   reach the main thread due to the reporting delay, the latter will be
//!   discarded and the error from `func` returned instead.
//!   Due to this, there is no guarantee on how much data is still written
//!   after the custom error occurs.
//! * *panics* in the background writer are correctly forwarded to the main
//!   thread, but are also given lower priority if an error is returned from
//!   `func`.
//!
//! # Flushing
//!
//! Trying to mimick the expected functionality of `io::Write` as closely as
//! possible, the [writer](struct.Writer.html) provided in the `func`
//! closure in the main thread also forwards `flush()` calls to the background
//! writer. `write` and `flush` calls are guaranteed to be in the same order as
//! in the main thread. A `flush` call will always trigger the writer in the
//! main thread to send any buffered data to the background *before* the actual
//! flushing is queued.
//!
//! In addition, `flush()` is **always** called after all writing is done.
//! It is assumed that usually no more data will be written after this, and a
//! call to `flush()` ensures that that possible flushing errors don't go
//! unnoticed like they would if the file is closed automatically when dropped.
